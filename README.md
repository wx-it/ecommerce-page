I created this as my last javascript project before jumping into reactjs, this was a bit challenging to make at first then it got easy, the following project include so many features such as: 
- Adding a certain amount of shoes to the cart found in the navbar by incrementing the count and clicking the add to cart button.
- Ability to see the total price in the cart + the chosen product.
